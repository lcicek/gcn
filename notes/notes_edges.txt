Observation:
Removing an edge between two actors from the graph signifies that the two actors
are not in the same movie.

Example:
Given a movie consisting of actors {0, 1, 3} and removing the edge between actors
0 and 3 results in the new movies: {0, 1} and {1, 3}.

Conclusion:
Removing an edge from a graph increases the amount of movies in the graph.

Another Observation:
The GNNExplainer's visualizations cluster actors in the same movie closer together,
i.e. clusters of actors represent movies. As edges are removed from the graph,
the two actors/nodes belonging to the removed edge will be pushed farther apart.

Example:
Graph:                                                                   2
    0 1                               2                                 
   2   3  => remove edge[0, 1] => 0   3   1 => remove edge [2, 3] => 0   4   1
     4                                4
                                                                         3

Corresponding movies:
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4} => {0, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4} =>  {0, 2, 4}, {0, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}

Conclusion:
Removing an edge from a graph not only increases the amount of movies in the
graph but also increases the distance between nodes. If there are a lot of nodes in 
the graph (15+ or so), previously clear clusters become spread apart and entangled.
This causes a readability issue in both the visualized clusters as well as the implicit movies
of the graph. This graph feature can be referred to as "messiness".

Hypothesis:
Messiness is a predictor for 0-graphs (and vice versa).

Explanation:
Messiness implies that there is a sizeable overlap of actors within different movies.
It also implies a higher number of actors per movie since movies with small casts cannot be messy. 
In that sense, the messiness feature is closely connected to the size-of-cast feature hypothesized
in notes.txt.
It's also worth noting that just looking through the visualized graphs, shows that
1-label graphs are quite clean and 0-label graphs are quite messy.
